      "longDescription": "Fluffy's Flight is a charming arcade game that takes players on an endless descent with Fluffy, an adorable baby parrot, as it overcomes its fear of heights. Inspired by the core mechanics of Helix Jump, players swipe to rotate a 3D tree structure, guiding Fluffy through safe openings while avoiding broken bricks and gaps. Developed using Unity, I handled the complete game development cycle, from concept to deployment, including implementing physics-based movement, procedural level generation, and integrating multi-platform login, cloud save, and real-time leaderboards. The game also features monetization through Unity LevelPlay with IronSource and ad placements. Published successfully on the Google Play Store, Fluffy's Flight combines immersive gameplay, colorful visuals, and relaxing music to offer a skill-based, addictive experience suitable for all ages.",

As a Junior Game Developer and Project Manager at this project, I contributed to crafting an immersive narrative experience that highlights Sri Lanka's tea culture, biodiversity, and Dilmah’s core values of kindness, authenticity, and sustainability. I co-developed the narrative-driven RPG adventure game, overseeing the entire development process as Project Manager. Set in a stylized yet realistic depiction of the Dunkeld Tea Estate, the gameplay blends exploration, character-driven storytelling, and quest-based progression. My responsibilities included designing and implementing nine interactive minigames (eight completed, one in development), and developing and designing the main menu, settings menu, quest system, full UI/UX design, and visual effects to support thematic storytelling. The project is currently unreleased and intended as a branded serious game for global audiences.",

  "longDescription": "Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! is a 2D Unity game inspired by the viral Pedro the Raccoon meme. The player is shown a moving magnifying glass (created using an inverted mask effect), which scans across the screen at random speeds. Beneath it, Pedro the raccoon hides within a larger background layer. The player must click on Pedro the moment he’s visible through the magnifying glass before it moves away. With quick reflexes and precise timing, the challenge lies in spotting and clicking Pedro before he disappears again. It’s a light-hearted reflex test wrapped in meme-fueled chaos.",
